This is my first program and game ever. CD-Action magazine encouraged me to programming, and it goes on, and ooooonn

Unfortunately, I've lost the source code, just the executable and data files survived :/

If you want to run it, you have to trust me.
If you don't, then you probably won't lose anything.
